# GEOG458 Lab 2 - Edward Park

## Winter 2024

## i. The topic as well as the parameters you have used for search 

The social topic I chose for this lab is web privacy since it's been interesting to explore the complexities and implications associated with online data protection. The search terms that I used for my three word clouds were 'Digital Privacy,' 'Online Protection,' and "Digital Security."

## ii. Why do you want to make this comparison

In terms of digital data, there are numerous ways you can describe or approach the topic, and since I'm particularly interested in the subject of privacy, I decided to use the three search terms I mentioned above that would help me find information about it

## iii. Compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds

From all three word clouds, there were, of course, a couple of the same words being emphasized, notably words (but not exclusive to) "Protect," "Online," "Privacy," "Secure," and interestingly, "Free," which is something I did not expect. The three clouds also had their individual words that were different; they had some emphasis, with three of them being "Govern," "Scam," and "Time."

## iv. What might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed

Since words such as Digital and Online are pretty interchangeable in how people discuss them, the words "Online" and "Privacy" are likely to appear in all three of the clouds. The word privacy is often used when discussing regulations and laws, explaining the correlation as to why the word "Govern" might've appeared in the search "Digital Privacy." Words such as 'Scam' are linked to things such as online shopping, which in this case could be why it appeared in the search term 'Online Protection.'

## v. How your research could be improved in the future

Since the three search terms were very broad and not very specific, to enhance the research on finding similarities and differences, I could be more specific about the aspects of digital privacy or online protection I'm interested in examining.

## vi. Anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you

This lab has highlighted the importance of carefully selecting search terms when exploring a topic. While there were notable overlaps, each cloud also featured distinctive words, establishing connections between our search queries and the results obtained. I am interested in seeing whether other search algorithms are similar or different across various websites and search engines, beyond just YouTube. Considering the potential impact of search content and the suggestion from the lab to incorporate location-specific terms, there could be a lot more to discover, both in terms of internal aspects and outcomes.
